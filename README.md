# Sortable List Component

A project idea from https://www.frontendpro.dev/ for a custom accordion.

## Features

- A minimum of 4 sections that expand and collapse.
- Clicking on a section header toggles the section open or closed.
- The icon should change from plus to a cross icon when the accordion item is expanded.
- Responsive and displays correctly on different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- React.js: Front-end library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.
- SASS: Preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, providing features like variables, nested rules, and mixins to make CSS more maintainable and extendable.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, offering features like type checking, interfaces, and advanced tooling to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.
